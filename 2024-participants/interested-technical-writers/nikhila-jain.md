Nikhila Jain | [Portfolio](https://www.nikhilajain.com) | I'm a Technical Writer with extensive experience in developer-focused documentation, Docs-as-Code, API documentation, and the Diataxis framework to structure content effectively. My strengths lie in creating clear tutorials, how-to guides, and contributing to open-source projects, with a focus on improving documentation workflows through GitHub and Docs-as-Code practices. With proficiency in static site generators like Docusaurus and GitBook, and a solid background in programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, AWS, React, and Node, my goal is always to deliver technically accurate and accessible documentation for developers. With over a decade of experience in software development and more than eight years leading cross-functional teams, my journey has been deeply enriching, significantly sharpening my leadership skills, and understanding user personas that helps in writing clear and quality docs. Committed to efficiency and quality, I actively apply Agile methodologies to streamline documentation processes and accelerate delivery times.
