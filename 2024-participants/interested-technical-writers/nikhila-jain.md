Nikhila Jain | [Portfolio](https://www.nikhilajain.com) | As a Technical Writer, I specialize in Developer-focused documentation, Docs-as-Code methodologies, API documentation, and the implementation of the Diataxis framework for structured documentation. I'm skilled at creating engaging tutorials and how-to guides, contributing to open-source projects, and enhancing documentation workflows with Docs-as-Code practices using GitHub. Proficient with static site generators like Docusaurus and GitBook, and coupled with a strong background in programming languages (Java, JavaScript, AWS, React, Node), I am focused to produce technically accurate and developer-friendly documentation. Bringing over a decade of experience in software development, and more than 8 years leading cross-functional teams—including developers, testers, business analysts, and technical writers—has been a profound learning journey that further honed my leadership skills. I am a firm believer in Agile methodologies, which I've successfully implemented to streamline and expedite documentation processes.
